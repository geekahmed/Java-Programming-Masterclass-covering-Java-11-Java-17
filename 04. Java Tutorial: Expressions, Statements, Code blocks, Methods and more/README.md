- A method is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of code grouped together to perform a certain task or operation.
- There are two types of methods in Java:
    - Predefined Method: are the method that is already defined in the Java class libraries.
    - User-defined Method: written by the user or programmer.
- A method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class is known as a static method.
- Overloaded methods are differentiated by the number and the type of the arguments passed into the method.
- Overloaded methods should be used sparingly, as they can make code much less readable.
